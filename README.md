# LinkedIn-Easy-Apply
The notebook searches for only Easy Apply job postings. The search is specified in the first cell.

Note that LinkedIn job searches allow for minus signs, indicating for the query to avoid those terms.
For example, "python developer -senior -manager" will remove all roles with "senior" or "manager" in the title.

The notebook can also be used after the filters are applied, as it applies generic filters now.
